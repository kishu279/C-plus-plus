# Learning C/C++

## Online Resources

### C Libraries:
- [GNU C Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/)
- [C Standard Library Documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c)

### C++ Libraries:
- [Boost C++ Libraries](https://www.boost.org/)
- [C++ Standard Library Documentation](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp)

### Native Libraries:
- [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
- [Windows API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/)

## What You Can Do With C:
- System programming (Operating systems, file systems, etc.)
- Embedded systems (microcontrollers, hardware interaction)
- High-performance computing (complex simulations, calculations)
- Developing compilers or interpreters
- Network programming

## Standard Template Library (STL) in C++:
- **Containers**: `vector`, `list`, `deque`, `map`, `set`, etc.
- **Algorithms**: `sort()`, `find()`, `reverse()`, etc.
- **Iterators**: A unified way to access elements in containers.
- **Functors**: Objects that can be treated as functions, allowing for customized operations in algorithms.
